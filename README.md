# Footballers-Conceptual-Lattice

This study aims to create a Conceptual Lattice of Footballers according to the Formal Concept Analysis principles. 
The Lattice's objective is to trace the similarities and the differences between footballers, allowing to see what are the specific traits of a given footballer, which players they share the most traits with, and also which players share wanted similarities while also displaying different desirable traits.
To do so, we decided to use FbREF (which is property of Sports Reference) data due to their extensive span of different data, and applied dimensionality reduction methods to assess multidimensional latent variables aiming to explain a certain trait within a specific position. 

Scraping scripts are taken from https://github.com/parth1902/Scrape-FBref-data and the Lattice is built over the fcaR library https://github.com/neuroimaginador/fcaR.
